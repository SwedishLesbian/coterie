# Project Status

This document provides an overview of the current status of the Coterie project.

## Phase 1 Status: Core Functionality

We are currently in Phase 1 of development, focusing on establishing the core framework and implementing the essential features.

### Completed Items

- ✅ Project structure and architecture design
- ✅ Basic SQLAlchemy models and database setup
- ✅ Main application window framework
- ✅ Character creation dialog 
- ✅ Vampire character sheet implementation
- ✅ Import dialog for Grapevine (.gvc) and exported (.gex) files
- ✅ LARP trait system implementation
  - ✅ Created `LarpTrait` and `TraitCategory` models
  - ✅ Implemented `LarpTraitWidget` and `LarpTraitCategoryWidget`
  - ✅ Added `TraitConverter` utility for dot rating to adjective conversion
  - ✅ Updated character sheet to use LARP trait system
  - ✅ Enhanced import dialog to properly handle LARP traits
  - ✅ Updated character creation with LARP trait selection
  - ✅ Implemented automatic data conversion from original files
- ✅ Basic chronicle management
  - ✅ Chronicle creation and editing
  - ✅ Character association with chronicles
  - ✅ Chronicle metadata tracking
  
### In Progress

- ⏳ Complete import/export functionality
  - Importing from Grapevine files is implemented
  - Exporting to Grapevine format still needed
- ⏳ Character list view implementation
- ⏳ Staff and player management interface
- ⏳ Challenge system implementation

### Pending Items

- ⬜ Character search and filtering
- ⬜ Game data management (natures, clans, etc.)
- ⬜ Notes and custom fields
- ⬜ Experience tracking and management
- ⬜ Character relationships tracking

## Phase 2 Planning

In Phase 2, we plan to focus on:

1. Additional character types (Werewolf, Mage)
2. Experience point system
3. Chronicle management
4. Enhanced character relationships
5. Game aids and storytelling tools

## Critical Issues

- ✅ **RESOLVED**: LARP Trait System Implementation - Converted dot-based trait system to adjective-based for Mind's Eye Theater LARP
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Character Creation `IntegrityError` - Fixed `NOT NULL` constraint on `characters.narrator` by making the field nullable.

## Next Development Tasks

1. Complete testing of LARP trait system and import functionality
2. Implement character list view
3. Implement character data exporting
4. Add challenge resolution system for LARP traits
5. Begin work on Werewolf character sheet

## Known Issues

1. Character creation dialog needs validation
2. Import dialog needs better error handling and data validation
3. Some UI elements need styling improvements
