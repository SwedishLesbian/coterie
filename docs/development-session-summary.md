# Development Session Summary

This document provides a summary of our development progress to help pick up where we left off in future sessions.

## Latest Development Session

**Date:** [Current Date]

### Completed Work

1. **Import Dialog Implementation**
   - Created `ImportDialog` class in `coterie/ui/dialogs/import_dialog.py`
   - Implemented file selection for both .gvc and .gex files
   - Added character filtering and selection functionality
   - Implemented progress tracking for import operations
   - Added character data extraction from both file formats

2. **Data Loading Utilities**
   - Added methods in `DataLoader` class to parse Grapevine 3.x (.gvc) files
   - Added methods to parse Grapevine exported character (.gex) XML files
   - Implemented utilities to convert parsed data to Coterie's format
   - Created file detection and routing based on file extensions

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created comprehensive UI components documentation
   - Updated all documentation to reflect name change from "Grapevine 4.0" to "Coterie"
   - Updated component roadmap and conversion checklist
   - Created development session summary for continuity
   - Corrected documentation to specify Mind's Eye Theater LARP system instead of tabletop World of Darkness

### Current State

- The application can now import character data from both .gvc and .gex files
- Imported character data is converted to Coterie's JSON format
- The import dialog provides filtering, selection, and progress tracking
- All documentation has been updated to reflect the current state

### Next Steps

1. **Character List View**
   - Implement the character list view to display imported characters
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Connect to newly imported character data

2. **Character Export**
   - Implement export functionality to complement the import
   - Support exporting to both .gex and possibly a new Coterie format

3. **Validation**
   - Add validation to the character creation dialog
   - Improve validation in the import process
   - Ensure data integrity throughout the application

## Project Details

2. `docs/ui-components.md` - New UI components documentation
3. `docs/status.md` - Updated status with latest progress
4. `docs/component-roadmap.md` - Updated component status
5. `docs/conversion-checklist.md` - Updated checklist with completed items
6. Various other documentation files updated to reflect name change and correct system reference

### Current Development Branch

- Working on `feature/import-dialog` branch
- Ready to merge into `develop` branch

## Environment Setup for Next Session

1. Clone the repository if needed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coterie.git
   cd coterie
   ```

2. Create or activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python -m coterie
   ```

## Testing Requirements

- Test import functionality with various .gvc and .gex files
- Verify proper conversion of character data
- Ensure UI is responsive and user-friendly

## Known Issues to Address

1. Import dialog needs better error handling for malformed files
2. Some parts of the import process need performance optimization
3. UI styling needs refinement for better user experience

## Additional Notes

- The renaming from "Grapevine 4.0" to "Coterie" is now complete throughout the codebase and documentation
- All new components should follow the patterns established in the UI components documentation
- Important correction: Coterie is for Mind's Eye Theater LARP system, not tabletop World of Darkness
- Remember to update this summary after each significant development session
