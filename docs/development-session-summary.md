# Development Session Summary

This document provides a summary of our development progress to help pick up where we left off in future sessions.

## Latest Development Session

**Date:** [Current Date]

### Completed Work

1. **LARP Trait System Implementation**
   - Implemented the `dot_rating_to_adjectives` method in `TraitConverter` class to convert dot ratings to adjective traits
   - Updated `VampireSheet` to use `LarpTraitWidget` and `LarpTraitCategoryWidget` for trait display
   - Modified `ImportDialog` to correctly handle LARP traits during character import
   - Updated `CharacterCreationDialog` with a tabbed interface for LARP trait selection
   - Created helper methods to suggest appropriate clan disciplines and common traits
   - Implemented the `create_vampire_from_dict` method in `DataLoader` to properly create characters with LARP traits

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Added scrollable trait sections for better usability
   - Implemented context menus for managing LARP traits (renaming, marking as spent)
   - Added progress indicators and status messages during import
   - Created intuitive trait selection interfaces with helper buttons

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Ensured proper data flow from character creation to database storage
   - Implemented adjective-based trait conversion for all trait categories (attributes, abilities, disciplines)
   - Created appropriate widget hierarchies for trait management
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing character data

4. **Documentation Cleanup**
   - Organized documentation directory structure
   - Archived reference materials (rules, VB source code) to reduce clutter
   - Updated index.md to reflect current project status
   - Ensured documentation is consistent with LARP trait system implementation
   - Restructured documentation sections for better navigation

### Current State

- The application now correctly implements the Mind's Eye Theater LARP trait system
- Traits are represented as collections of adjectives rather than dot ratings
- Users can create, import, and manage characters using the LARP trait system
- The UI provides appropriate interfaces for adjective-based trait management
- Data conversion from original Grapevine files to LARP traits is handled automatically
- Documentation structure is clean and well-organized

### System Alignment Progress

We've completed the implementation of the Mind's Eye Theater LARP trait system:

- ✅ **Technical Documentation**: Added detailed documentation of the Mind's Eye Theater LARP trait system
- ✅ **Data Models**: Created `LarpTrait` and `TraitCategory` models for proper trait representation
- ✅ **UI Widgets**: Implemented specialized widgets for displaying and managing adjective traits
- ✅ **Trait Conversion**: Added methods to convert between dot ratings and adjective traits
- ✅ **Character Sheet**: Updated to use and display LARP traits
- ✅ **Import Dialog**: Enhanced to properly handle LARP traits during character import
- ✅ **Character Creation**: Updated to use the LARP trait system for new characters

### Next Steps

1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the import functionality with various character files
   - Validate that trait conversion works correctly across all trait types
   - Ensure proper display of traits in the character sheet
   - Test character creation with different character types

2. **Challenge System Implementation**
   - Implement the trait-based challenge resolution system
   - Add trait bidding and selection interfaces
   - Implement trait spending mechanics
   - Add trait refresh/recovery functionality

3. **Additional Character Types**
   - Extend the LARP trait system to other character types (Werewolf, Mage, etc.)
   - Implement appropriate trait categories for each character type
   - Create specialized character sheets with LARP trait support

2. `docs/ui-components.md` - New UI components documentation
3. `docs/status.md` - Updated status with latest progress
4. `docs/component-roadmap.md` - Updated component status
5. `docs/conversion-checklist.md` - Updated checklist with completed items
6. `docs/technical.md` - Added comprehensive LARP trait system documentation
7. Various other documentation files updated to reflect name change and correct system reference

### Current Development Branch

- Working on `feature/larp-trait-system` branch
- Ready to merge into `develop` branch

## Environment Setup for Next Session

1. Clone the repository if needed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coterie.git
   cd coterie
   ```

2. Create or activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python -m coterie
   ```

## Testing Requirements

- Test import functionality with various .gvc and .gex files
- Verify proper conversion of character data to LARP trait system
- Test the LARP trait widgets with different trait categories
- Ensure UI is responsive and user-friendly

## Known Issues to Address

1. Import dialog needs better error handling for malformed files
2. Some parts of the import process need performance optimization
3. UI styling needs refinement for better user experience
4. ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Trait system conversion from dot-based to adjective-based

## Additional Notes

- The renaming from "Grapevine 4.0" to "Coterie" is now complete throughout the codebase and documentation
- All new components should follow the patterns established in the UI components documentation
- Important correction: Coterie is for Mind's Eye Theater LARP system, not tabletop World of Darkness
- Coterie will NEVER be used for tabletop characters, only for LARP characters
- The trait adjective lists in `TraitConverter` may need refinement based on LARP rulebook
- Remember to update this summary after each significant development session
