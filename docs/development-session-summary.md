### Known Issues to Address

1. UI styling needs refinement for better user experience

## Environment Setup for Next Session

1. Clone the repository if needed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coterie.git
   cd coterie
   ```

2. Create or activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Import menu files:
   ```bash
   # Import all menu files
   python -m coterie --import-menus import/

   # Import specific menu files
