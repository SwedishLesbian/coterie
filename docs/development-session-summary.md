# Development Session Summary

This document provides a summary of our development progress to help pick up where we left off in future sessions.

## Latest Development Session

**Date:** [Current Date]

### Completed Work

1. **UI Improvements and Terminology Updates**
   - Changed "Narrator" to "HST" throughout the application
   - Added active chronicle to window title bar
   - Renamed "Players" menu to "People" with staff and player management
   - Added "All Chronicles" view for global character and player lists
   - Fixed chronicle assignment bug with LARP traits

2. **LARP Trait System Implementation**
   - Implemented the `dot_rating_to_adjectives` method in `TraitConverter` class to convert dot ratings to adjective traits
   - Updated `VampireSheet` to use `LarpTraitWidget` and `LarpTraitCategoryWidget` for trait display
   - Modified `ImportDialog` to correctly handle LARP traits during character import
   - Updated `CharacterCreationDialog` with a tabbed interface for LARP trait selection
   - Created helper methods to suggest appropriate clan disciplines and common traits
   - Implemented the `create_vampire_from_dict` method in `DataLoader` to properly create characters with LARP traits

3. **Chronicle Management Enhancements**
   - Added active chronicle display in window title bar
   - Implemented chronicle assignment dialog with proper trait preservation
   - Created "All Chronicles" view with global character and player lists
   - Added staff and player management menu items
   - Updated chronicle creation dialog to use "HST" terminology

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated project documentation to reflect UI terminology changes
   - Added documentation for new chronicle management features
   - Updated development session summary with latest progress
   - Revised component roadmap to prioritize staff/player management
   - Updated technical documentation for LARP trait system

### Current State

- The application now correctly implements the Mind's Eye Theater LARP trait system
- Traits are represented as collections of adjectives rather than dot ratings
- Users can create, import, and manage characters using the LARP trait system
- The UI provides appropriate interfaces for adjective-based trait management
- Data conversion from original Grapevine files to LARP traits is handled automatically
- Chronicle management system is in place with proper character assignment
- Documentation is up-to-date with latest changes

### Next Steps

1. **Staff and Player Management**
   - Implement staff manager interface
   - Create player manager dialog
   - Add role-based permissions system
   - Integrate with chronicle management

2. **Challenge System Implementation**
   - Design challenge resolution interface
   - Implement trait bidding system
   - Add trait spending mechanics
   - Create trait refresh/recovery functionality

3. **Additional Character Types**
   - Extend LARP trait system to other character types
   - Create specialized character sheets
   - Update import/export functionality
   - Add appropriate validation rules

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test chronicle assignment with various character types
   - Validate LARP trait conversion across all categories
   - Test staff and player management features
   - Verify proper trait preservation during chronicle changes

### Known Issues to Address

1. Staff and player management interfaces need implementation
2. Some parts of the chronicle assignment process need optimization
3. UI styling needs refinement for better user experience
4. ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Staff and player management system implementation

### Additional Notes

- The renaming from "Narrator" to "HST" is now complete throughout the codebase
- All new components should follow the patterns established in the UI components documentation
- Important correction: Coterie is for Mind's Eye Theater LARP system, not tabletop World of Darkness
- Coterie will NEVER be used for tabletop characters, only for LARP characters
- The trait adjective lists in `TraitConverter` may need refinement based on LARP rulebook
- Remember to update this summary after each significant development session

## Environment Setup for Next Session

1. Clone the repository if needed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coterie.git
   cd coterie
   ```

2. Create or activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python -m coterie
   ```

## Testing Requirements

- Test import functionality with various .gvc and .gex files
- Verify proper conversion of character data to LARP trait system
- Test the LARP trait widgets with different trait categories
- Ensure UI is responsive and user-friendly

## Known Issues to Address

1. Import dialog needs better error handling for malformed files
2. Some parts of the import process need performance optimization
3. UI styling needs refinement for better user experience
4. ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Trait system conversion from dot-based to adjective-based

## Additional Notes

- The renaming from "Grapevine 4.0" to "Coterie" is now complete throughout the codebase and documentation
- All new components should follow the patterns established in the UI components documentation
- Important correction: Coterie is for Mind's Eye Theater LARP system, not tabletop World of Darkness
- Coterie will NEVER be used for tabletop characters, only for LARP characters
- The trait adjective lists in `TraitConverter` may need refinement based on LARP rulebook
