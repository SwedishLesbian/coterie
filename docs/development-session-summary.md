# Development Session Summary

This document provides a summary of our development progress to help pick up where we left off in future sessions.

## Latest Development Session

**Date:** [Current Date]

### Completed Work

1. **Import Dialog Implementation**
   - Created `ImportDialog` class in `coterie/ui/dialogs/import_dialog.py`
   - Implemented file selection for both .gvc and .gex files
   - Added character filtering and selection functionality
   - Implemented progress tracking for import operations
   - Added character data extraction from both file formats

2. **Data Loading Utilities**
   - Added methods in `DataLoader` class to parse Grapevine 3.x (.gvc) files
   - Added methods to parse Grapevine exported character (.gex) XML files
   - Implemented utilities to convert parsed data to Coterie's format
   - Created file detection and routing based on file extensions

3. **LARP Trait System Implementation**
   - Added `LarpTraitWidget` class to display and manage adjective-based traits
   - Implemented `LarpTraitCategoryWidget` to manage collections of traits
   - Created `LarpTrait` and `TraitCategory` database models
   - Updated the `Character` base model to support LARP traits
   - Implemented a `TraitConverter` utility class for trait system conversions
   - Added comprehensive technical documentation for the Mind's Eye Theater trait system

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created comprehensive UI components documentation
   - Updated all documentation to reflect name change from "Grapevine 4.0" to "Coterie"
   - Updated component roadmap and conversion checklist
   - Created development session summary for continuity
   - Corrected documentation to specify Mind's Eye Theater LARP system instead of tabletop World of Darkness
   - Added technical documentation for the Mind's Eye Theater trait system

### Current State

- The application can now import character data from both .gvc and .gex files
- Imported character data is converted to Coterie's JSON format
- The import dialog provides filtering, selection, and progress tracking
- All documentation has been updated to reflect the current state
- The LARP adjective-based trait system is now properly implemented with dedicated widgets and models

### System Alignment Progress

We've identified and started addressing the critical issue with the trait system:

- ✅ **Technical Documentation**: Added detailed documentation about the Mind's Eye Theater LARP trait system
- ✅ **Data Models**: Created `LarpTrait` and `TraitCategory` models to properly represent adjective traits
- ✅ **UI Widgets**: Implemented `LarpTraitWidget` and `LarpTraitCategoryWidget` for displaying and managing traits
- ✅ **Utility Functions**: Created `TraitConverter` to help with conversions between trait systems
- ✅ **Database Updates**: Modified the `Character` model to support LARP traits

### Next Steps

1. **Complete LARP Trait System Integration**
   - Update the character sheet to use the new `LarpTraitWidget` instead of the dot-based `TraitWidget`
   - Ensure the import dialog correctly maps imported traits to the LARP system
   - Test the LARP trait system with actual character data

2. **Character List View**
   - Implement the character list view to display imported characters
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Connect to newly imported character data

3. **Character Export**
   - Implement export functionality to complement the import
   - Support exporting to both .gex and possibly a new Coterie format

4. **Validation**
   - Add validation to the character creation dialog
   - Improve validation in the import process
   - Ensure data integrity throughout the application

2. `docs/ui-components.md` - New UI components documentation
3. `docs/status.md` - Updated status with latest progress
4. `docs/component-roadmap.md` - Updated component status
5. `docs/conversion-checklist.md` - Updated checklist with completed items
6. `docs/technical.md` - Added comprehensive LARP trait system documentation
7. Various other documentation files updated to reflect name change and correct system reference

### Current Development Branch

- Working on `feature/larp-trait-system` branch
- Ready to merge into `develop` branch

## Environment Setup for Next Session

1. Clone the repository if needed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coterie.git
   cd coterie
   ```

2. Create or activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python -m coterie
   ```

## Testing Requirements

- Test import functionality with various .gvc and .gex files
- Verify proper conversion of character data to LARP trait system
- Test the LARP trait widgets with different trait categories
- Ensure UI is responsive and user-friendly

## Known Issues to Address

1. Import dialog needs better error handling for malformed files
2. Some parts of the import process need performance optimization
3. UI styling needs refinement for better user experience
4. ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Trait system conversion from dot-based to adjective-based

## Additional Notes

- The renaming from "Grapevine 4.0" to "Coterie" is now complete throughout the codebase and documentation
- All new components should follow the patterns established in the UI components documentation
- Important correction: Coterie is for Mind's Eye Theater LARP system, not tabletop World of Darkness
- Coterie will NEVER be used for tabletop characters, only for LARP characters
- The trait adjective lists in `TraitConverter` may need refinement based on LARP rulebook
- Remember to update this summary after each significant development session
