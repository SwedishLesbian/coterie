## Environment Setup for Next Session

1. Clone the repository if needed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coterie.git
   cd coterie
   ```

2. Create or activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Import menu files:
   ```bash
   # Import all menu files
   python -m coterie --import-menus import/

   # Import specific menu files
   python -m coterie --import-menus import/ --menu-names "Grapevine Menus" "Dark Ages Menus"

   # Import without conflict resolution
   python -m coterie --import-menus import/ --non-interactive
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python -m coterie
   ```

## Testing Requirements

- Test menu file import with various .gvm files
- Verify trait selection dialog functionality
- Test conflict resolution during import
- Verify trait categorization and organization
- Test search and filtering in trait selection

## Known Issues to Address

1. Menu import needs better error handling for malformed files
2. Some menu categories may need manual organization
3. UI styling needs refinement for better user experience
4. ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Menu system implementation

## Additional Notes

- The menu system is now fully integrated with the LARP trait system
- All new components follow the patterns in the UI components documentation
- Important correction: Coterie is for Mind's Eye Theater LARP system
- Coterie will NEVER be used for tabletop characters
- Remember to update this summary after each significant development session
